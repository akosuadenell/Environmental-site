    <p>
      Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake </br>
      had been largely under the control of real </br>
      estate developers. Construction activities have </br>
      resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters. </br>
      Currently, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is </br>
      regulating construction along the shoreline and </br>
      has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over </br>
      recent decisions. These regulations are unpopular </br>
      with many residents, especially those in the </br>
      Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.</br>
  </p>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<p>
    The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe </br>
    Blue) has been an environmental watchdog in the </br>
    Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years. Founded when a </br>
    proposal to build a four-lane highway around the </br>
    lake (with a bridge over the entrance to Emerald </br>
    Bay) was proposed in 1957, the League has </br>
    thwarted poorly designed development projects </br>
    and environmentally unsound planning. The </br>
    League embraces responsible and diversified use </br>
    of the Lake's resources while protecting and </br>
    restoring its natural attributes.

<p>UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. </br>
  The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research </br>
  Center is dedicated to research, education and </br>
  public outreach, and to providing objective </br>
  scientific information for restoration and </br>
  sustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each </br>
  year, it produces a well-publicized "State of the </br>
  Lake" assessment report.
